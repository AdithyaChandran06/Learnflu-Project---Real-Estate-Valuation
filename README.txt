The project uses a Linear Regression model to predict real estate prices per Ping based on features like house age, distance to MRT, and nearby convenience stores. The dataset was preprocessed by removing irrelevant columns, scaling features using StandardScaler, and splitting it into 80% training and 20% testing data. The model was trained to minimize Mean Squared Error (MSE) and evaluated using metrics like MSE and R-squared (RÂ²). Linear Regression was chosen for its simplicity, efficiency, and interpretability in modeling linear relationships. The trained model provides accurate predictions and insights for property valuation, aiding informed decision-making.
